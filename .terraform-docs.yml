  # Easy ACI - Comprehensive example for ACI & NDO

  ### YAML Schema for auto-completion, Help, and Error Validation:

  If you would like to utilize Autocompletion, Help Context, and Error Validation, `(HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)`, make sure the files all utilize the `.eza.yaml` file extension.

  And Add the Following to YAML: Schemas in Visual Studio Code: Settings > Search for YAML: Schema: Click edit in `settings.json`.  In the `yaml.schemas` section:

  ```bash
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-cisco-modules/easy-imm/main/yaml_schema/easy-imm.json": "*.ezi.yaml"
  ```

  Soon the Schema for these YAML Files have been registered with [*SchemaStore*](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/blob/master/src/api/json/catalog.json) via utilizing this `.eza.yaml` file extension.  But until that is complete, need to still add to settings.

  ## Use Cases

  There are two examples in this Repository.  The first example is shown in the primary folders:

    * `access-policies/`
    * `admin/`
    * `fabric-policies/`
    * `switch/`
    * `system_settings/`
    * `tenants/`
    * `virtual-networking/`

  ### IMPORTANT NOTE

  Notice the `eza.yaml` extension on the files.  This is how the  `data.utils_yaml_merge.model` is configured to recognize the files that should be imported with the module.

  The other examples are shown in the `./RICH/` Folder Structure.  This is what is being used for our lab in Richfield, Ohio.  In these examples there are four sub-folders.

    * `RICH/Asgard` - The First ACI Fabric
    * `RICH/Wakanda` - The Second ACI Fabric
    * `RICH/Odin` - Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator managing the stretched Tenants Between the two Fabrics
    * `RICH/shared_settings` - YAML Data that is the same between Asgard and Wakanda

  The Structure of the YAML Files is very flexible.  You can have all the YAML Data in a single file or you can have it in multiple individual folders like is shown in this module.  The important part is that the `data.utils_yaml_merge.model` is configured to read the folders that you put the Data into.  In the single Data Center example the data is read from all the folders in the root path described above (`access-policies`, `admin`, `fabric-policies`, `switch`, `system-settings`, `tenants`, `virtual-networking`).  In comparison, the Asgard and Wakanda Fabrics, read files in their respective home directory plus they shared data found in the `./RICH/shared_settings` folder.  

  Additionally because the `./RICH/Odin/` Nexus Dashboard Fabric Only supports pushing configuration with the tenants module, currently, only the `built_in_tenants` and `tenants` modules are defined.  The additional function for `Odin` is that it is pulling in the switch_profiles, from both `Asgard` and `Wakanda`, to build `EPG -> Static Path Bindings` in NDO.  And since NDO is being used to build the Tenant policies, there is an additional modules used in `Asgard` and `Wakanda`, which is the AAEP to EPG module for mapping EPG's to the Attachable Access Entity Profiles, as this is not yet supported by Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator.

  ### Modify `global_settings.eza.yaml` to match environment

  `global_settings.eza.yamls` contains variables related to authentication to the controller and an optional global annotations for tagging objects.

  #### Notes for the `global_settings.eza.yamls`

    * Controller: Defines all the settings for Authentication to an APIC or Nexus Dashboard Orchestrator Controller.
    * management_epgs: necessary if you are using inband EPG's, and or the ooband EPG is not default.  Both true for our use case.
    * annotations: helpful, but not required.  This is used on Tenant Objects that support the annotations attribute.  You can customize this according to anything desired to add, but by default the use case is the version of the easy_aci module is being added.

  #### Note 1: Modules can be added or removed dependent on the use case.  The primary example shown is consuming/showing a full environment deployment.  But in the `./RICH/Odin/` example, it is just using the tenant modules. 

  #### Note 2: The reason for the seperation of `built_in_tenants` vs `tenants` is to make sure objects are always created in common/mgmt first.  So they can be consumed by user tenants or Admin/Fabric etc (management EPGs for example).  If nothing is being configured in common/mgmt/infra the `built_in_tenant` is not necessary.

  ## [Cloud Posse `tfenv`](https://github.com/cloudposse/tfenv)

  Command line utility to transform environment variables for use with Terraform. (e.g. HOSTNAME â†’ TF_VAR_hostname)

  Recently I adopted the `tfenv` runner to standardize environment variables with multiple orchestration tools.  tfenv makes it so you don't need to add TF_VAR_ to the variables when you add them to the environment.  But it doesn't work for windows would be the caveat.

  In the export examples below, for the Linux Example, the 'TF_VAR_' is excluded because Cloud Posse tfenv is used to insert it during the run.

  ### Make sure you have already installed go
  
  ## [go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

  ```bash
  go install github.com/cloudposse/tfenv@latest
  ```

  ### Add go/bin to PATH

  ```bash
  GOPATH="$HOME/go"
  PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"
  ```

  ### Aliases for `.bashrc`

  Additionally to Save time on typing commands I use the following aliases by editing the `.bashrc` for my environment.

  ```bash
  alias tfa='tfenv terraform apply main.plan'
  alias tfap='tfenv terraform apply -parallelism=1 main.plan'
  alias tfd='terraform destroy'
  alias tff='terraform fmt'
  alias tfi='terraform init'
  alias tfp='tfenv terraform plan -out=main.plan'
  alias tfu='terraform init -upgrade'
  alias tfv='terraform validate'
  ```

  ## Environment Variables

  Note that all the variables in `variables.tf` are marked as sensitive.  Meaning these are variables that shouldn't be exposed due to the sensitive nature of them.

  The first three variables are for authentication to either APIC or NDO controllers.  The rest are for configuration parameters in the Fabric.  These sensitive variables are all combined together in `locals.tf` into five objects:

    * `access_sensitive`
    * `admin_sensitive`
    * `fabric_sensitive`
    * `system_sensitive`
    * `tenant_sensitive`

  Using this object structure like this allows for the amount of a single variable to be flexible enough for any environment.  In previous iterations of this repository many of the variables were added with five iterations to cover most use cases, but if more were needed it wasn't possible to add more.  By combining the variables into the object model, you can add or remove variables as needed.

  Compare the files `./locals.tf`, `RICH/Asgard/locals.tf`, and `RICH/Odin/locals.tf`.  Notice in the Asgard example most of the variables are taken down to a single iteration, as additional instances are not being consumed.  And with the Odin example, where only the tenant module is utilized, the other iterations of sensitive variables have been removed.

  The sensitive variables are still exported as individual variables as I am unsure of a good method of loading the variables into the environment in a better method, but would always appreciate feedback if there is an easy way to build an object model in an export command.

  export ntp_key_1='<ntp_key_1>'
  ```

    * SNMP Communities

  ```bash
  export snmp_community_1='<snmp_community_1>'

  ```

  ## Execute the Terraform Plan

  ### Terraform Cloud

  When running in Terraform Cloud with VCS Integration the first Plan will need to be run from the UI but subsiqent runs should trigger automatically

  ### Terraform CLI

  * Execute the Plan - Linux

  ```bash
  # First time execution requires initialization.  Not needed on subsequent runs.
  terraform init
  terraform plan -out="main.plan"
  terraform apply "main.plan"
  ```

  * Execute the Plan - Windows

  ```powershell
  # First time execution requires initialization.  Not needed on subsequent runs.
  terraform.exe init
  terraform.exe plan -out="main.plan"
  terraform.exe apply "main.plan"
  ```
